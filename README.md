# income_tax
This code deducts a fixed amount from the annual income (50000) and then calculates the tax based on different income brackets. Here's how it works:

The user is prompted to input their annual income.

The script subtracts 50000 from the annual income to get the final_income.

It then checks which income bracket final_income falls into and calculates the tax accordingly. The tax rates increase as the income bracket goes up.

The calculated tax amount is printed for the respective income bracket.

This  code appears to be well-structured and correctly calculates the income tax for different income ranges. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this code, please feel free to ask.
